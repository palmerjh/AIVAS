*********************NOTES*********************
Densest square was calculated using following density formula:
	-given pix n and wts w (from template), density = np.average(n,weights=w)
	-idea: prioritize blackness in middle where information is most important and more readily lends itself to accurate matching
		-why: in-depth explanation in retina.py regarding wts.
