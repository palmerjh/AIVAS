**************NOTE****************
Densest square was calculated using following density formula:
	-given pix n and wts w (from template), density = average of np.average(1-n,weights=w) and np.average(n,weights=1-w)
	-idea: prioritize whiteness in middle and blackness on outside
		-why: response to previous results where anomalous black spots (i.e. errors in tracing resulted in thicker lines than the original) 
		in target corresponded to densest area; when such an anomalous area is used as the target, it was far from matching with the thinner-lined original
