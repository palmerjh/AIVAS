Notes:

YEAHHHH SUCCESS!!!

-however, time elapsed = 5139.306000 seconds (for both targets)
	-vast majority of time spent in initial density delta search
	-300 to 600 seconds in rotational search, rest in density delta search
-ideas:
	-only do a handful of rings (top 5 densest? --> factor of 6 speedup from using all 28 rings + blindspot) for refined density 
	-try using sum-product which more so prefers matching blackness than matching whiteness
	-needed 1400 in queue to get actual into all choice-wise queues (look at debug_target0)
		-new heuristic that is more admissible and differentiating?
